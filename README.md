# Memento mori
Memento mori - remember death. A calendar/goal setting app that incentivizes the user through its perhaps slightly morbid timekeeping. The first-time user will get to enter age and other relevant information for an estimation of how many weeks he/she has left to live. This information will then be displayed to the user on the homepage of the application and is updated with the passing of time. Other than this it's just a standard calendar/todo app.

1. npm i
